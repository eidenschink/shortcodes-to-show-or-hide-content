### Welcome to the GitHub Repository

This is a fork of the plugin [shortcodes-to-show-or-hide-content](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcodes-to-show-or-hide-content/) just to include the patches of the pull requests 27, 46 and 42 of the original repo and the result of a [rector](https://getrector.com/) run with e.g. LevelSetList::UP_TO_PHP_82 (but that was not really necessary). 

## Original project ##
You can find the original project [here](https://github.com/theukedge/shortcodes-to-show-or-hide-content/). Thanks to the author!
